## 🎓 How to Verify Accuracy

### Option 1: Run the Accuracy Checker Script

```bash
cd path/to/smart_agri
python check_accuracy.py
```

This will display:

- Complete accuracy metrics
- Classification reports
- Cross-validation results
- Per-crop performance
- Error metrics

### Option 2: Manual Verification (Crop Recommendation)

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Load data and model
data = pd.read_csv('DataSets/Crop_recommendation.csv')
model = joblib.load('Models/crop_rec.pkl')

# Split data
X = data[['N', 'P', 'K', 'temperature', 'humidity', 'ph', 'rainfall']]
y = data['label']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

### Option 3: Manual Verification (Crop Yield)

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, MinMaxScaler
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Load and preprocess data
df = pd.read_csv('DataSets/crop_yield.csv', encoding='latin1')
df['Season'] = df['Season'].str.strip()

# Encode features
le_crop = LabelEncoder()
le_season = LabelEncoder()
df['crop_encoded'] = le_crop.fit_transform(df['Crop'])
df['season_encoded'] = le_season.fit_transform(df['Season'])

# Prepare features
X = df[['crop_encoded', 'season_encoded', 'Area', 'Annual_Rainfall', 'Fertilizer', 'Pesticide']]
y = df['Production']

# Scale features
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Load model
model = joblib.load('Models/crop_yield.pkl')

# 5-Fold Cross Validation
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
r2_scores = []

for train_idx, test_idx in kf.split(X_normalized):
    X_train, X_test = X_normalized[train_idx], X_normalized[test_idx]
    y_train, y_test = y.iloc[train_idx], y.iloc[test_idx]

    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    r2_scores.append(r2_score(y_test, y_pred))

print(f"Average R² Score: {sum(r2_scores)/len(r2_scores):.4f}")
print(f"Accuracy: {sum(r2_scores)/len(r2_scores) * 100:.2f}%")
```
